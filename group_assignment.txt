--in this case, i'm determining which product is top-selling by the total amount of money generated by the sales of that product

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, SUM(od.UnitPrice * od.Quantity) AS Amount
FROM Products p
INNER JOIN 'Order Details' od
USING (ProductID)
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY Amount DESC
LIMIT 3;


--in this case, i'm determining the top-selling product by the quantity of products sold

SELECT ProductName, Unitsonorder AS Order_qty
FROM Products p 
Order by 2 DESC 
LIMIT 3;


-- in this case, i'm finding the solution by determining the total quantity shipped 

SELECT OrderID, SUM(Freight) AS qty_shipped
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderID
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
